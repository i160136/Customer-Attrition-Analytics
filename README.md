# Customer-Attrition-Analytics
### Run index.py for Application. This project aims for predicting customer attrition in an effort to retain them. We worked on data which included customers that have already churned (response) and their characteristics / behavior (predictors) before the customer turnover happened. By fitting a machine learning model that relates the predictors to the response, we predicted the response for existing customers. With the help of this project, an organization can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs for a good business.
