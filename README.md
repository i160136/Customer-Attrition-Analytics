# Customer-Attrition-Analytics
### Run index.py for Application
#### This project aims for predicting customer attrition in an effort to retain them. We will look at data which includes customers #### that have already churned (response) and their characteristics / behavior (predictors) before the customer turnover happens. #### By fitting a machine learning model that relates the predictors to the response, we will predict the response for existing #### customers. With the help of this project, an Organization can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer #### retention programs for a good business.
